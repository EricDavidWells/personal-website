        Blobs is an environment full of blob-like organisms that fight for survival by eating food and each other. 
        The organisms that eat the most and live the longest have a higher chance for their genes to be included in the next blobâ€™s reproduction. 
        Over time, (kind-of) intelligent behaviour will emerge. 
        Feel free to tweak the settings, specifically the fitness function, to obtain various results. 
        I have yet to convince the blobs only to eat blobs of smaller size; they seem to go for an all or nothing strategy of eat everything or run away from everything.
