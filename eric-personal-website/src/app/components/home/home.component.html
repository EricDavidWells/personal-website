        Hello! My name is Eric Wells.  I'm a robotics engineer from Canada.
        I've had a ton of fun exploring robotics through autonomous submarines, upper limb prosthetics, and lately to dexterous manipulation of humanoid robots focusing on teleoperation.
        You can download my <a href="assets/resume.pdf">resume</a> here to see more details on my work experience, and please check out my project portfolio.
